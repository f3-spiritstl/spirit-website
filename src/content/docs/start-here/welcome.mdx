    I envision this page being a quick, high-level overview that would be super helpful for FNGs. I took a stab at some stuff below but feel free to edit the ðŸ’© out of it.

## What is F3?

F3 is a free men's workout group, but it is also so much more than that. Stick around to find out what makes F3 so special.

### History

F3 started in Charlotte, North Carolina in 2011 and has grown to nearly every state in the US and to many countries around the world, with over 3,000 workouts scheduled each week.

The three F's in our name stand for Fitness, Fellowship, and Faith - the third of which we define as simply a belief in something bigger than yourself.

### Mission

F3's Mission is to plant, grow, and serve small workout groups for men for the invigoration of male community leadership.

### Principles

F3 is built on five core principles:

<Steps>

1. ##### **It is free**

    F3 always has been and always will be free

2. ##### **Open to all men**

    F3 workouts are open to all men, regardless of ability

3. ##### **Held outdoors**

    F3 workouts are always held outdoors: hot or cold, rain or shine

4. ##### **Peer led**

    Workouts are peer-led in a rotating fashion

5. ##### **Ends in a COT**

    All workouts end in a Circle of Trust

</Steps>

### Credo

Our credo is "Leave no man behind, leave no man where you found him."

### What We Do

F3 is a workout group, so yes - we exercise together. But as you read above, our mission is workout groups with the purpose of invigorating male community leadership. We believe that men need authentic relationships with other men who are striving to be strong fathers, husbands, and leaders. Getting in better shape is a great benefit, but the relationships, brotherhood, and community is the real glue of F3.

## Our Region

F3 is broken down into many regions across the country (and the world). The St. Louis metropolitan area (called the St. Louis Gateway Mega-Region) is comprised of over 20 regions and is the fastest growing area in the country.

The Spirit of St. Louis region is located in West St. Louis County, and includes everything south of Interstate 64, west of Interstate 270, north of Big Bend Road (roughly, as it doesn't extend to the far western boundary of the region), and east of the Missouri River.

### Locations

Our region consists of 16 different AOs (Areas of Operation) - 13 regular AOs, one Black Diamond AO (tougher workouts), one running AO and one rucking AO. You can find out more about each of them, including where they are located and when they meet, on our [locations page](/reference/locations).
